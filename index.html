        <h3>Why the programming course?</h3>
        <p>I decided to take a <strong>programming class</strong> at Moringa School because, my intrest<br>
        was on learning how to use the command line, to have linux as my current operating system,<br>
        learn how to use and interact with git and github, learn javascript and jquery and also css.<br>
